<h2>About Nesh</h2>

<b>Nesh's purpose:</b> Nesh is a company based out of Houston, TX with the goal of creating a chatbot to assist Oil and Gas companines obtain information and data in a more efficient and quick manner. Our team partnered with Nesh to offer another solution to assist them with their ultimate goal. <br/>

<b>Nesh's Features:</b> Our team created a Nesh using Google Dialogflow which allows users to have a natural converstaion when asking questions in regards to drilling info, well data, etc. The chatbot runs off a Raspberry Pi 4B, takes in a user's question, and displays the answer through our front-end React app. The data is queried from a PostgreSQL database, and is sent to the front-end using a Google Dialogflow webhook. 

<b>Some questions to ask Nesh:</b> <br/> <br/>
"Show me the wells in the East Texas Basin."<br/>
"Which wells have the highest cumulative BOE?"<br/>
"How many wells came online last month?"
